# Visualized Examples

Interactive visualizations for every homework/project assignment in this repository. Each page re-implements the course's MATLAB/Simulink model in plain JavaScript using the **same equations, parameters, and numerical schemes** as the original files, with sliders, scenario presets, and hoverable Plotly charts.

## How to use

Open **`index.html`** (or any individual page) in a browser — no MATLAB, install, or server needed. An internet connection is required the first time so the Plotly.js charting library can load from its CDN.

## Fidelity notes

- **HW1 (blood pressure)** uses the exact semi-implicit Euler update from `Psa_new.m` and the triangular systolic flow pulse from `QAo_now.m` (100 steps/cycle, 16 cycles), including the heart-block modification (QAo = 0 for 0.03–0.13 min).
- **HW2 (left heart)** implements the Hoppensteadt–Peskin time-varying ventricular compliance C_LV(t) with the course constants (tauS = 0.0025, tauD = 0.005 min), diode valves, and the `AoBkflo` aortic-regurgitation term.
- **HW3 (glucose-insulin)** uses the standard parameterization of Khoo's minimal model, which reproduces the course's fasting steady state (0.81 mg/ml glucose, 0.057 IU/ml insulin at QL = 8400 mg/hr) and the Type 1 (κ, insulin production) / Type 2 (η, insulin sensitivity) severity gains. Drug models are the one-compartment Bateman PK models specified in the assignment.
- **HW4 (Hodgkin-Huxley)** is a line-by-line transcription of Dr. Peskin's scripts: same rate functions, same semi-implicit gate/voltage updates, dt = 0.01 ms. The resting potential is recomputed from E_K via the chord-conductance weights (0.0945/0.9055) exactly as Part 2 of the assignment derives.
